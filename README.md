# Farm Irrigation Network Visualizer

This Python project visualizes a farm irrigation system using Tkinter, NetworkX, and Matplotlib. It allows users to view the irrigation network, calculate the minimum spanning tree (MST), and find optimal paths between two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Features
- Interactive GUI using Tkinter
- Displays irrigation network and MST
- Finds shortest water distribution path between nodes

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install required packages:
# Farm-Irrigation-Network
